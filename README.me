# Agent-based-Ridesharing-Simulation
The "Agent-based Ridesharing Simulation" project involves creating a Python program to simulate a ridesharing system in a city. Focus on implementing the algorithm with 30 vehicles and random graph structures, optimizing pickup and drop-off requests for efficiency.
